# TeleMonBot


## TEST TEST this is an for 
Monitor and log to SQLite your Windows/Linux server via Telegram + ThingSpeak (freaky, yep?)

Python 2.7 script

Write to my bot and see how it works ([List of commands](https://github.com/EKOsh/TeleMonBot/blob/master/README.md#command-list)):
> https://telegram.me/EKOshTower_bot

Be patient - it doesn't work 24/7

Used python libraries: psutil, telepot, PyQt4 and peewee
> Don't install them, the code will install them itself

The code is really raw right now... But, well, you can use it and tell me about your experience. My telegram is @E_KOsh. Email e.m.koshmin@gmail.com

For read before sleep: www.thingspeak.com/ www.telegram.org/
